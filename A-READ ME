This is a project called coin freedom. 
I made this for Hackclub.
Use arrow keys left and right for moving left and right and space for jumping. 
The point of the game is to escape the cycle and get back to the first part of the game which just is for movement controls so you know the movement.
I have placed no lore in the game. 
This project should have no AI but the closest it would be might be 1% from me trying to learn how to code from people online
